# JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

## Project Overview

This project focuses on core JavaScript concepts such as object-oriented programming, prototypes, closures, scope, inheritance, and the use of modern ES6+ syntax. Through building various classes and utility functions, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience applying theoretical JavaScript concepts in practical scenarios.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I am able to explain (without external references):

- Why JavaScript is an amazing programming language
- How to create and manipulate objects in JavaScript
- The meaning and use of the `this` keyword
- What `undefined` represents
- The importance of variable type and scope
- What closures are and how they work
- JavaScript prototypes and how they relate to inheritance
- How to implement inheritance in JavaScript

---

## Requirements

- **Language:** JavaScript (Node.js 14.x)
- **Editor:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Code Style:** Semi-standard (Standard + Semicolons)
- **OS:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Execution:** All files must be executable and start with `#!/usr/bin/node`
- **Linting:** Use `semistandard` for code formatting and linting

### Setup

Install Node.js 14:

```bash
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Install semistandard globally:
```bash
$ sudo npm install semistandard --global
```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Class-based object-oriented design

- Proper use of this and context

- Error-proof constructors and data validation

- Functional programming with .map() and .reduce()

- Using closures to preserve state

- Prototype-based inheritance in JS

## Code Style

All code adheres to semistandard coding style:

- Based on Standard JS

- Includes semicolons
